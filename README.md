# CAPSTONE_PROJECT

To realize the significant factors of a restaurant that appeal to customers. This was done by analyzing the trends of their preferences and mining their reviews , thus helping us extract the relevant features and predict the rating of a restaurant. A possible extension of this project to production  is to  provide prescriptive analytics to aid both new and failing restaurants.
